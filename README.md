One liners for Alfred Clipboard Pipes
================================

This is a repo to keep track of one liners I use with the [Alfred Clipboard Pipes Workflow](https://github.com/ramiroaraujo/alfred-clipboard-pipes-workflow). Of course, they're simple bash commands with basic dependencies any OSX should meet.

The easiest way of importing them to the workflow is to copy the code content and use the workflow UI to add it.
